    <h2>Angie Anuman</h2>
    <p>
      Angie Anuman grew up in a small village with a big dream of becoming a
      chef. When she turned 18 she worked three jobs so she could pay for her 
      studies in a cooking school. After graduating in 2012, she found minor job as
      a cook. Until one day a food youtuber went to the restaurant while he was on his
      journey trying different foods and he loved the food there. He showed her in the video,
      and that's how we found her and added her to the team.
